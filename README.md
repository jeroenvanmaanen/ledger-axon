# ledger-axon
Ledger for multiple bank accounts loosely arranged according to the [six jars principle](http://6jars.com).

This is a reimplementation of the JavaScript based [ledger](https://github.com/jeroenvanmaanen/ledger) project.

This implementation is based on the [Axon Framework](https://github.com/AxonFramework) by [AxonIQ](https://axoniq.io).
